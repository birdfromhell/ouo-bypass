# Ouo.io Bypass Project 

Ouo.io Bypass is a Python application developed with the FastAPI framework. It provides a tool for bypassing ouo.io URLs. 

## System Requirements
* Python 3.11.5
* FastAPI
* Pydantic

## How to Run the Application

1. Install all necessary packages as mentioned in the system requirements.

2. Use the following command to run your FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to access the application. 

## API Endpoints

1. `GET /`: Access this root endpoint to get a welcome message indicating the service is running.

   The expected response would be:

    ```json
    { "message": "This is ouo.io Bypass" }
    ```

2. `POST /bypass/`: Make a POST request to this endpoint to bypass the ouo.io URL. 

   The body of the request should be as follows:

    ```json
    {
      "url": "<insert ouo.io url here>"
    }
    ```

The response will depend on the `ouo_bypass` function.
